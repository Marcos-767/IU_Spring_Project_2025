## Idea:
The purpose of this project is to detect changes in trends within a financial sector to warn stockholders as soon as possible of changes that are happening within the sectors of the stocks they hold. Stocks act in a close to random manner in short time periods so we will be solving this by looking at more stable leaders within the individual industries. As we are looking at the leaders they will reflect changes early on before they affect other stocks giving us some early warnings that we would otherwise not be aware of.
